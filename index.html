        <h3>Phase One</h3>
            <p class="text1">
Oron was in existence in the pre-colonial period in Nigeria and was formerly a part of the province called the South-Eastern state.
 Natives of this area speak the dialect also known as Oron. 
History has it that by 2370 BC Oron also known as {Oro Nation} had already been settled down in the present location known as Akwa Ibom State of 
Nigeria on the West Coast of African Sub Region, Akwa Ibom Gulf Line to Gulf of Guinea Atlantic Ocean South, after the Great flood
 (Noah`s deluge). The Community as at then and up until this moment is embedded with their dialect Language originated by them as far
  back as 2370 BC, not borrowed elsewhere or from the Bantus, Cameroun and/or Palestinian. The mass movements raided by Bantus 
  the warriors, into many Communities did not mean that Oro people migrated from the Bantus, the Cameroun or Palestinians.
   None of Oro Nation culture or names was derived from Bantu or any language elsewhere as immigrant. 
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="phasebx">
        <h3><P>Phase Two</P></h3>
   <p class="text1">
   The Oros are peculiar people, strong contenders in nature 
   wherever they are found. The origin of Oro is traceable to a wrestler called <b> Abang.</b> Abang was a warrior so 
    powerful with huge muscles, the Head and Chief wrestler known as `Mbok’. The wrestling known as (Mbok) was originated by 
    Abang the warrior from Africa which was displayed by the African slaves after a day`s job, to the admiration of the Guards
     who watches over them at work thereby creating relaxation chances for them at work before it spread and developed as wrestling 
     around the whole world today. Abang the warrior with his group gallantly fought against the slave masters who were in the area for 
     slave trade business. One day, he was over powered and captured with few of his group and were taken to the present day Israel of 
     what was then Egypt. This is perhaps why it may be more than a mere coincidence that the only two nations on earth with places
      named “Oron” are Israel and Nigeria.
    </p>
    </div>

      <div class="phasebx">
          <h3>Phase Three</h3>
      <p class="text1">
Abang later escaped from Egypt during the Muslem celebrations period through River Nile as a strong contender in boat regatta 
with few of his men. He sailed down to Sudan via Lake Chad and settled within the North East now Jigawa State, Nigeria in a small 
area and named it <b>'Oron'</b> which was written and pronounced as <b>'Oronny'</b> in line with Oros` phonemes migrations. As he was not comfortable 
with Islam, he escaped to a place call Usahadit area in the present day Cameroon. There, Abang begot Do, Do begot Doni, Doni begot 
Oro and Obolo. The group later returned to their original homeland due to dispute over farmland with Usahadit people. 
It is this return of Abang that has made some historian believe that Oro Nation is one of the Palestinian and Bantu ethnic 
nationalities that migrated from somewhere around Israel through Egypt (North Africa) to North Eastern Africa through Ethiopia 
(Abyssinia) to Central Africa (around the present-day Congo Republic & Democratic Republic of Congo) and through the southern 
Cameroons to the present day Niger Delta region of South-Southern Nigeria. On their return, Doni moved to establish the present
 day Andoni in Rivers State while Obolo established the present day Eastern Obolo of Akwa Ibom State.

                <p class="text">Oron is found in the flood plain of South Eastern Nigeria, with the land mainly intersected by numerous
                     streams and tributaries flowing into Cross River. The entire coastline stretches from Uya Oron to Udung Uko.
                    Oron is in the tropical region and has a uniformly high temperature all the year round. The two main seasons are the dry 
                    which spans between October and April and wet season which starts around May and ends in September. There are also two prevailing
                     winds – the South-West onshore winds which brings heavy rains and the North- East trade winds blowing across the Sahara Desert,
                      which brings in the dry season.

        <p class="text">Oron is rich in oil and natural gas. Most of its oil reserves are off-shore. There are 25 corked oil wells.
             Oron is presently rated as having one of the highest supplies of natural gas deposits in sub-Saharan Africa with large 
             amounts of untapped natural gas and oil at Ukpata, Udung Okung, and Edik Ekpu.
            The region is extremely fertile and is known for its topographical Oil Palm Belt, tropical rainforest, swamps, and beaches.
             The mangrove forests also provide timber and raw materials for medicinal purposes. There are also deposits of solid minerals
              such as iron, free silica or glass sand and gravel. Seafoods such as crayfish, snipers, oyster and periwinkle abound
             richly in all coastal areas.

                        Oron people were among the earliest to encounter Western education in West Africa. This is most evident with
                         the establishment of the Hope Waddell Training Institute, Calabar in 1895 and the Methodist Boys’ High School,
                          Oron in 1905. These schools are two of the oldest in the history of Nigeria and attracted students from all 
                          over Western and Central Africa.

                    <p class="text">
                        With a well formidable socio-cultural group called the Oron Union founded in 1925, the Oron people became one
                        of the most formidable and vocal groups in the South-South region of Nigeria, hence one of the three political
                        forces in the present day Akwa Ibom State.
                        Oron became a Division in August 1970 and in 1976, was made a local government area. However, following the local government creation
                        exercise of the federal government in 1989,
                        Oron was split into 3 Local Government Areas of Mbo, Oron and Okobo. Again in September 1991, Urue Offong/Oruko
                        Local Government Area was carved out of Oron Local Government Area. Finally in December 1996,
                        Udung Uko Local Government Area was further carved out of Oron.
                        Currently, the Oron people are still struggling in their attempts to properly place the Oron union in a position
                        to control their political interests in the state. In the past, the Oron Union has put up such structures as the
                        CWC (Central Working Committee), Esumbuke Oro, and quite recently, the Oron Think-Tank, and many others to address
                        certain issues. There has been little success with these structures, when compared to the political expectation
                        of the average Oron person within the state and Nigeria.

                    <p class="text">
                        The Oron people have a unique culture and tradition. The Ekpe Society, which was shared with the Efiks and the Southern 
                        Igbos as well as the Ibibios, is used throughout Oron Land as the authority. There are other traditional cults and societies
                         which include the Ekpo, Abang, Edeme Awan Ñkwuho, Ekong, Afiakegit, Kongoma, Mbok, Ababa, Nnabo,and many others. All these 
                         societies, in addition to the unique hospitality of the Oron people, their arts, rich diet, Oil and Gas minerals, have been 
                         known to attract tourism and commerce to the area and Akwa Ibom state in general.
                        The Oron people have a very colourful mode of traditional dressing, especially with an Iyara (which is red in colour).
                         The red Iyara is usually worn with a white tailored traditional shirt and a wrapper (large fabric wrapped around the waist) to match. 
                         This wrapper is commonly worn by several peoples of southern Nigeria. Sometimes it can be combined with the rich Efik native piece of 
                         cloth (tie), usually a colourful silk material. Recently the Oron people have been known to tie a piece of cloth usually in form of a
                          handkerchief on the neck. This cloth could be white or coloured depending on the user and his combination intent. 
                        A blend of the neck handkerchief and the Efik native tie is also very common among the Oron people. Generally, apart from 
                        the distinction of the red Iyara, it is not easy to distinguish an Oron man or woman from an Efik person in terms of attire and the culture.
                         These attires are also sometimes used by the Ibibio and Annang groups of Akwa Ibom state; except that the Annang and Ibibio people
                         will not put on the red Iyara of Oron people because of its political implications and consequence.
